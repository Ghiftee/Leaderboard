# Built With
- HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Webpack, Javascript, leaderboard API

### Interaction with the leaderboard API
- First, add the [base url](https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/)
- Create a new game. The POST method is used to create a new game and the game must have a name
  e.g
    { 
    "name": "My cool new game" 
    }
  Each created game has a result in the form of a unique ID or key called the gameId
- There are two allowed actions to access the scores, the POST and GET methods
- POST method creates a new score for the given game and it requires that a username and point is first given
- GET method however does not require any input from the user and its function is just to return the list of users and their scores
- Get the gameID then chain it with the base url to get the score.

## More information about interacting with the API can be found in [The Leaderboard API Documentation](https://www.notion.so/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3)
